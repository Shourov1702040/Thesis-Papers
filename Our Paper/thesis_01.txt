Accurate object classification in hyperspectral images (HSI) is one of the greatest ways for remote sensing image processing. Deep learning is most frequently used in conventional computer vision tasks. In recent the Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) has been noticed remarkably in hyperspectral image (HSI) classification. As the number of spectral bands in HSI is more than 100, so that feature reduction and feature selection is big issue while dealing with HSI images. In this paper, our proposed method is Blender-SN (Blender Spectral CNN) expressed as feature reduction, feature selection, and deep learning with hybrid spectral CNN as a spectral-spatial 3D-CNN followed by spatial 2D-CNN to enhance hyperspectral image classification. Dimension reduction technique such as Principal Component Analysis (PCA), Minimum Noise Fraction (MNF), or Factor Analysis (FA) is combined with a feature selection method such as Mutual Information (MI), Minimum Redundancy Maximal Relevancy (MRMR) before applying hybrid spectral CNN. We led through experiments dependent on three openly accessible datasets. Those hyperspectral image datasets such as the Indian Pines, University of Pavia, and Salinas Scene remote sensing data sets are used to evaluate the performance of the Blender-SN (Blender Spectral CNN) method. We compared our experimental results with the state-of-the-art hand-crafted as well as end-to-end other deep learning-based methods and it confirms the superiority of the proposed deep learning model in HSI classification.
